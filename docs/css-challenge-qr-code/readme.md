# QR code component

A small practice project to recreate the QR code component from the Frontend Mentor challenge. This repository contains a single static page (`index.html`) that demonstrates a compact card with a QR code image, a title and short description. The layout is implemented with semantic HTML and a small amount of CSS (inline in `index.html`) and uses Google Fonts.
